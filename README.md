# Firebase Assignment - Train Scheduler (Basic - Recommended)

## Overview

I created a train schedule application that incorporates Firebase to host arrival and departure data. My web application retrieves and manipulates this information with Moment.js. This website provides up-to-date information about various trains, namely their arrival times and how many minutes remain until they arrive at their station.

## Instructions

Add a train name, destination, the time the first train associated with the train line departs, and the frequency that the trains depart from their original stop.

The application will calculate the time the next train should arrive and the minutes until that time. This information will display above the form used to submit the information.
